# Summary

Steganalysis is the practice of detecting the presence of hidden information 
within digital media, such as images, audio, or video. It involves analyzing 
the media for signs of steganography, which is the technique used to conceal 
information within the carrier file. Steganalysis techniques can include 
statistical analysis, visual inspection, and machine learning algorithms to 
uncover the hidden data. The goal of steganalysis is to determine whether a 
file contains covert information and potentially identify the steganographic 
method used.

Steganalysis has become increasingly important in the face of rising espionage 
and stegomalware threats, particularly in the context of data exfiltration. 
In this scenario, malicious actors leverage steganographic techniques to 
conceal sensitive data within innocent-looking files, evading traditional 
security measures. By detecting and analyzing such covert communication 
channels, steganalysis helps identify and prevent data exfiltration attempts, 
safeguarding critical information from falling into the wrong hands. 

In recent years, there has been a significant growth in the interest of 
researchers towards the field of steganalysis. The application of deep learning
[@Boroumand:2019:SRNet;Yousfi:2020:alaska2]
in steganalysis has opened up new avenues for research, 
leading to improved detection rates and enhanced accuracy. As the field 
continues to evolve, experts are actively exploring novel architectures and 
training methodologies to further refine the performance of deep learning-based 
steganalysis.


# Statement of need

Aletheia addresses two main needs. Firstly, it aims to provide 
specialized analysts with a tool that implements modern steganalysis algorithms, 
leveraging deep learning techniques. These algorithms are designed to 
effectively handle even the most advanced steganography techniques. Secondly, 
Aletheia serves as a valuable tool for researchers by simplifying the process 
of conducting experiments and comparing methods. It includes simulators for 
state-of-the-art steganography methods, enabling researchers to prepare and 
evaluate their work efficiently.


On the other hand, to the best of the authors' knowledge, Aletheia stands out 
as the sole steganalysis tool currently available that incorporates the 
latest detection techniques specifically designed to address the challenges 
posed by Cover Source Mismatch (CSM) in real-world steganalysis scenarios. 
[@Ker:2013:real_world]. This capability is particularly significant for 
conducting effective steganalysis in practical applications.
The issue of Cover Source Mismatch (CSM) remains an ongoing challenge that 
continues to captivate the interest of researchers.
